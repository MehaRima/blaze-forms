# templates:forms

A minimalist Meteor package for creating reusable forms and form elements, with support for
reactivity, validation, and submission (including complex workflows).

Compatible with Bootstrap and other UI frameworks.

This package uses [aldeed:simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) for field validation.

#### Comparison with aldeed:autoform

[aldeed:autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) and templates:forms serve different purposes:
- **aldeed:autoform** automatically generates insert and update forms for your collections.
It is a large and rich package, tightly integrated with aldeed:simple-schema and aldeed:collection2.
- **templates:forms** only provides a thin framework for building reusable forms, form elements and form workflows.

#### Installation

```sh
$ meteor add templates:forms
```
